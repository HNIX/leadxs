## Introduction

The LeadXS compliance system is designed to help your organization maintain regulatory compliance while collecting, processing, and distributing lead data. It provides comprehensive tracking, validation, and documentation of all data-related activities, with a focus on meeting current regulatory requirements, including FTC's 1:1 consent rule.

This guide explains how to set up and use the compliance features, what data to collect, and how to leverage the reporting capabilities to demonstrate and maintain compliance.

## Compliance System Overview

The LeadXS compliance system consists of several interconnected components:

### Core Components

1. **Compliance Records**: Documents all compliance-related events with immutable records
2. **Consent Management**: Tracks explicit consent with cryptographic verification
3. **Data Access Logs**: Records all access to personal information
4. **Validation Rules**: Ensures data quality and regulatory compliance
5. **Compliance Reports**: Provides auditable documentation of compliance activities

### Key Features

- **Immutable Records**: Once created, compliance records cannot be modified or deleted
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All events are logged with detailed context
- **Precise Timestamping**: Exact time and date for every event
- **User Attribution**: Records which user or system initiated each action
- **Verifiable Data**: Each record maintains contextual data and references
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Consent receipts and reports can be cryptographically verified

## Setting Up Compliance

### 1. Access Control Setup

Configure who can access compliance features by setting appropriate roles:

- **Compliance Admin**: Full access to all compliance features
- **Compliance Auditor**: Read-only access to compliance reports
- **Regular User**: Limited access to compliance data related to their actions

Set up these permissions in the Accounts section:

1. Navigate to **Accounts** > **Users**
2. Select a user and click **Edit Permissions**
3. Under the Compliance section, set appropriate role
4. Click **Save Changes**

### 2. Configure Compliance Settings

Set up global compliance settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Compliance**
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **Retention Period**: How long to keep compliance records (default: 7 years)
   - **Consent Expiration**: Default expiration for consent records (if applicable)
   - **Required Proof**: Level of evidence required for consent (IP, user agent, etc.)
   - **Report Signing**: Enable/disable cryptographic signing of reports
   - **Automatic Logging**: Configure which events are automatically logged

3. Click **Save Settings**

### 3. Set Up Data Model

Ensure your data model correctly identifies personally identifiable information (PII):

1. Navigate to **Verticals** > select your vertical > **Fields**
2. For each field, set the appropriate privacy classification:
   - **PII**: Personally Identifiable Information (name, email, etc.)
   - **Sensitive**: Special category data requiring additional protection
   - **Non-PII**: Data that doesn't identify individuals
   - **Anonymous**: Data safe for use in pre-qualification

3. For each PII field, configure:
   - **Anonymization Method**: How the field is anonymized in logs and pre-qualification
   - **Sharing Settings**: Whether the field can be shared in various contexts
   - **Consent Requirements**: What types of consent are needed to process this field

## Required Fields and Data Collection

Validation rules ensure data quality and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Types of Validation Rules

1. **Condition Rules**: Use a Ruby-like DSL to create complex conditions

   field('ssn').match?(/^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$/)
   ```

3. **Lookup Rules**: Check field values against predefined lists
   ```ruby
   # Example: Ensure state is valid US state
   VALID_STATES.include?(field('state').upcase)
   ```

4. **Dependency Rules**: Ensure dependent fields are provided
   ```ruby
   # Example: If phone_consent is true, require phone number
   !field('phone_consent') || field('phone').present?
   ```

5. **Comparison Rules**: Compare fields against other fields
   ```ruby
   # Example: Ensure confirm_email matches email
   field('email') == field('confirm_email')
